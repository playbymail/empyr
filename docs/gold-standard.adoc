= Executive Summary: Transitioning from a GOLD-Based Economy to a Consumer-Driven Model in EC

== Overview of the Problem

In the current design, *GOLD* functions as both a *wage currency* and a *finite natural resource*, creating a self-defeating economic loop. Each turn, population units are paid in GOLD, but that GOLD is permanently removed from circulation. Since GOLD is replenished only through low-yield mining operations, its scarcity creates deflationary pressure. This leads to several compounding issues:

* *Population growth and SOL improvements are disincentivized*, as each new unit represents a permanent drain on a fixed resource pool.
* *Expansion is stifled*, despite being a core victory condition.
* *Rebellions are structurally incentivized*, due to the inability to maintain SOL amid GOLD shortages.
* *Industrial strategy becomes imbalanced*, as the cost of supporting population through manufacturing CNGD becomes a punishment, not a tradeoff.

This mirrors *historical failures of hard-currency economies*, such as the Spanish Empire’s post-colonial decline despite massive gold/silver influxes or the stagnation of the U.S. during the late 19th century gold standard era.

To restore flexibility, stimulate economic growth, and rebalance gameplay, I propose three potential models:

== Three Proposed Solutions

=== 1. CNGD-as-Wage Model (Soft Currency Standard)

Population units are no longer paid in GOLD. Instead, they receive a quantity of CNGD based on their SOL needs. GOLD is used _only_ by the player (for trade, diplomacy, elite projects). This mirrors the real-world transition from gold-backed currencies to fiat-like economic systems.

*Key Features:*

- Wages = CNGD per unit of SOL level.
- Players must supply a minimum CNGD per population unit or risk rebellion.
- CNGD manufacturing becomes central to population management.

=== 2. Market Exchange Model (Dual Economy)

Population units are still paid in GOLD, but they _must_ use that GOLD to purchase CNGD from the player at player-defined prices. This creates an internal market where the player regains GOLD and controls inflation/deflation by adjusting the CNGD price.

*Key Features:*

- Wages in GOLD are still required.
- CNGD is priced in GOLD by the player.
- High SOL units demand more CNGD.
- Surplus or scarcity of CNGD affects rebellion risk.

=== 3. Tax and Redistribution Model (GOLD as Capital, CNGD as Wages)

Population units receive wages in CNGD. Players “tax” the population in GOLD (e.g., a portion of mined GOLD is retained by the population unless collected). This introduces a feedback loop where happy populations grow and pay more taxes.

*Key Features:*

- CNGD = wage → SOL → productivity.
- GOLD = tax revenue based on SOL or productivity.
- Poorly treated populations hide or hoard GOLD.

|===
|Feature / Model |CNGD-as-Wage |Market Exchange |Tax &amp; Redistribution 

|GOLD removed from economy? |No |No (circulates) |No (partial tax) 
|Flexibility for expansion |High |Moderate |High 
|Player economic control |Medium |High |High 
|Rebellion risk clarity |High |Variable |Medium 
|Manufacturing emphasis |High |High |Medium 
|Historical analog |Post-Bretton Woods (fiat) |Controlled Market Economy |Early Roman Empire / Feudal Taxation

== *Recommendation: Hybrid Model with Transition to CNGD Standard*

I recommend adopting *Model 2 (Market Exchange)* as a transitional step, followed by a full shift to *Model 1 (CNGD-as-Wage)* once the game economy has matured. This creates a *phased narrative of economic development* within the game universe:

. *Early Game (Hard Currency Economy):* Population is paid in GOLD, GOLD is rare, SOL is low, and expansion is costly.
. *Mid Game (Mixed Economy):* Players unlock the ability to price CNGD and create internal markets. GOLD recirculates.
. *Late Game (Consumer Economy):* GOLD is no longer used for wages. CNGD production and distribution drives population happiness and tax revenue.

This mirrors *real-world economic transitions*, such as:

- The *collapse of the gold standard* after WWII.
- The rise of *central banking and fiat currencies*.
- The *emergence of consumer economies* in the post-industrial age.



== *Final Notes on Game Balance and Emergent Strategy*

* Allow player empires to *diversify economic strategies*: mining-focused, manufacturing-focused, trade-based.
* Introduce *population classes* that respond differently to SOL (e.g., workers vs elites), enabling political and cultural mechanics.
* Let player behavior influence rebellion not only through SOL, but *through perceived fairness*, adding narrative depth.

This economic transition will *remove the artificial ceiling on growth*, restore the population as a productive asset, and create a *meaningful, strategic economic layer* grounded in both simulation fidelity and gameplay dynamism.

'''

Let’s now formalize the *Hybrid Model with a Transition to a CNGD Standard*, focusing first on the *Market Exchange* system and later evolving to a pure *CNGD-as-Wage* model.


== Phase 1: Market Exchange System (Transitional Economy)

=== Core Concept

Population units are paid wages in GOLD. To raise their Standard of Living (SOL), they must exchange their GOLD for CNGD, which the player manufactures. The player sets the *Price of CNGD* each turn. The population’s satisfaction is tied to how much CNGD they can afford and consume, based on that price.


=== Key Variables

|===
|Variable |Definition 

|`Pop` |Number of population units on a colony 
|`WagePerPop` |GOLD paid per population unit per turn 
|`TotalWages` |`Pop * WagePerPop` 
|`CNGDPrice` |Price of one CNGD unit in GOLD (set by player per colony) 
|`DesiredSOL` |Target SOL level of population (in CNGD units per Pop) 
|`CNGDConsumption` |Actual consumption = `min(Pop * DesiredSOL, CNGDAvailable)` 
|`SOLAchieved` |`CNGDConsumption / Pop` 
|`RebellionRisk` |A function of how far `SOLAchieved` falls below `DesiredSOL`
|===



=== Step-by-Step Game Logic

. *Pay Wages*
[source,text]
----
TotalWages = Pop * WagePerPop
GOLD removed from player storage
GOLD added to PopWagePool
----

. *Offer CNGD for Sale*
[source,text]
----
Player sets CNGDPrice
MaxPurchasableCNGD = PopWagePool / CNGDPrice
CNGDConsumption = min(MaxPurchasableCNGD, CNGDAvailable)
----

. *Resolve Consumption and Update SOL*
[source,text]
----
SOLAchieved = CNGDConsumption / Pop
GOLDCollected = CNGDConsumption * CNGDPrice
GOLD returned to player's treasury
----

. *Check Rebellion* +
Define `RebellionRisk` as:
[source,text]
----
if SOLAchieved >= DesiredSOL:
   RebellionRisk = 0
else:
   RebellionRisk = (DesiredSOL - SOLAchieved) / DesiredSOL
   (Apply random roll or threshold)
----



=== Optional Modifier: Social Programs / Price Caps

To avoid rebellion while still collecting GOLD, the player can set a *CNGD subsidy*, reducing effective CNGDPrice for the population while maintaining higher nominal prices (inflation narrative).



== Phase 2: CNGD-as-Wage Model (Post-Transition Consumer Economy)

=== Core Concept

The population is paid directly in *CNGD*, not GOLD. They do not hold GOLD or purchase goods directly. Instead, CNGD consumption is determined by what the player allocates. GOLD is retained as a strategic resource (trade, elite projects, diplomacy, research).



=== New Variables

|===
|Variable |Definition 

|`CNGDPerPop` |CNGD given per population unit 
|`SOLAchieved` |`CNGDPerPop` (1:1 relation) 
|`CNGDRequired` |`Pop * TargetSOL` 
|`RebellionRisk` |As in Phase 1 
|===



=== Game Logic

. *Player Allocates CNGD to Population*
[source,text]
----
CNGDPerPop = CNGDAllocated / Pop
SOLAchieved = CNGDPerPop
----

. *Check Rebellion*
[source,text]
----
RebellionRisk = max(0, (TargetSOL - SOLAchieved) / TargetSOL)
----

. *Taxation Model (Optional)*

Population generates tax revenue in GOLD proportional to SOL:

[source,text]
----
GoldTax = Pop * TaxRate * SOLAchieved
----



== System-Level Observations

|===
|System Feature |Market Exchange |CNGD-as-Wage 

|Currency Circulation |GOLD recirculates via trade |GOLD reserved for player usage 
|Population Agency |Medium (buying power matters) |Low (passive recipients) 
|Player Control |High (pricing levers) |High (allocation decisions) 
|Rebellion Risk Lever |Price &amp; quantity |Allocation quantity only 
|Gold Sink |Reduced or eliminated |Eliminated entirely 
|===



== Suggested Implementation Strategy

=== Turn 0–50 (Early Game)

* GOLD wages only.
* Population rebels often due to poor supply.
* Teach players to value CNGD production.

=== Turn 50–100 (Mid Game)

* Introduce *Market Exchange*.
* Let player set CNGD prices, manage both currency and manufacturing.

=== Turn 100+ (Late Game)

* Introduce *CNGD-as-Wage* policy (unlock via tech or political choice).
* Remove GOLD from wage loop.
* Enable GOLD taxes from high-SOL populations as bonus income.
